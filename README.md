## Project Background
The organization is facing a period of high employee turnover and stagnating productivity. Over the last quarter, HR has reported a significant increase in exit interviews, particularly within specialized departments. This project was commissioned by the Chief Operating Officer (COO) to diagnose the root causes of attrition, identify imbalances in department workloads, and evaluate the ROI of recent remote-work investments.

---

## Project Objective
* **Attrition Analysis:** Identify the primary drivers behind high turnover rates and pinpoint at-risk departments.
* **Workload Optimization:** Evaluate if specific teams are over-burdened and if this correlates with recent resignations.
* **Remote Work ROI:** Determine if employees in "Remote" or "Hybrid" roles are maintaining the same performance standards as "On-site" staff.
* **Resource Focus:** Provide data-backed recommendations for the Q1 retention budget and recruitment strategy.

---

## Datasets
* **Supermarket_sales_2025.csv:** Raw workforce data containing employee demographics, performance scores, and tenure details.
    * **Employee Profiles:** ID, Department, Job Role, Tenure, and Age.
    * **Performance & Status:** Satisfaction Scores, Productivity Ratings, and Employment Status (Active/Terminated).
    * **Engagement Metrics:** Commute Distance, Work-Life Balance ratings, and Monthly Income.

## Dashboard Features

* **Key KPIs:** Overall Attrition Rate, Average Satisfaction Score, Departmental Productivity, and Headcount Trends.
* **Visual Insights:** * Comparison of Attrition by Department and Job Level.
    * Correlation between Monthly Income and Employee Retention.
    * Performance distribution across different Work Modes (Remote vs. On-site).
    * Overtime impact on Employee Satisfaction.

---

## Key Findings
* **Critical Attrition Gap:** Turnover is significantly higher in junior roles and specific technical departments, often linked to low satisfaction scores rather than just salary.
* **Productivity Paradox:** Remote and Hybrid employees showed productivity levels that matched or exceeded On-site staff, justifying continued investment in flexible work infrastructure.
* **Overwork Correlation:** There is a direct link between high overtime hours and recent departures in the Sales and Support departments.
* **Financial Impact:** The cost of replacing high-turnover staff is beginning to impact departmental budgets, making retention strategies a top priority.

## Recommendations
1. **Retention (Priority 1):** Implement a targeted retention bonus or career-pathing program for at-risk roles in high-attrition departments.
2. **Mental Health & Balance:** Reduce mandatory overtime and introduce "wellness days" to combat burnout in overworked segments.
3. **Flexible Work Policy:** Formalize the Remote/Hybrid work policy given the proven maintenance of productivity standards.
4. **Compensation Review:** Conduct a market salary audit for roles with high attrition to ensure the organization remains competitive.

## Tools & Techniques
* **Microsoft Excel:** Pivot Tables, Advanced Charting, and Slicers for dynamic HR reporting.
* **Data Cleaning:** Transforming raw HR logs into clean, categorized metrics for attrition and satisfaction.
* **Strategic HR Analytics:** Designing KPIs to track workforce health and operational efficiency.
